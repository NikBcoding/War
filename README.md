# War




This is the basic outline of my game

	≈At start of game, a deck of 114 cards (19 different cards of 6 
	each) gets dealt to both players evenly (57 cards to each 
	player).

	≈With each turn a card is fliped face up from each player's 
	decks and gets compared based of their value.

	≈If playerCard > compCard, player wins the battle and takes 
	both cards and places them next to his/her current playing 
	deck, into a pile called "TOTAL CARDS WON".
        
	≈If playerCard < compCard, comp wins the battle and takes 
	both cards and are placed next to it's current playing deck, 
	into a pile called "TOTAL CARDS WON".

	≈If playerCard === compCard, "WAR" is declared.  Top 4 cards 
	from each deck will be placed in the  "Warfield" and the 5th 
	card will be fliped face up to declare the winner.  The winner 
	receives all the cards played that round, total of 12.

	≈If tie occurs again, 4 more cards will be added and 5th card 
	will be flipped face up to declare a winner, and so on so 
	forth, until a winner is met. 

	≈If playerCard === compCard and each player has <=4 cards 
	remaining in their Deck Count, the players draw a card from 
	their deck to see who wins the current cards and the previous 
	2 cards that were originally tied.

	≈Game goes on until both players have no more cards left in 
	their Deck Count, which at that point the winner of WAR is 
	declared based on who has more cards in their "TOTAL CARDS 
	WON" pile.
